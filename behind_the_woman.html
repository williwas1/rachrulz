        <h1> What you should know about the queen</h1>

    <div class="story_para">
    <p>When I was in university in my final year, a friend told me about a local drag show happening in the nearby pub where the cocktails were (and probably still are) plentiful and flavourful, I put on a stringy black wig and some smeared red lipstick and lipsynced to "Hit me baby one more time" by Britney Spears, it was the most fun despite probably being total rubbish.</p>
    <br>
    <p>When I saw the transformation some of these queens had gone through from no makeup to ALL the makeup, I knew a wig and some lipstick was not good enough and I decided to try it out properly.
        I came up with the name "Rachael Starla" on the fly, I simply combined my favourite girl name, Rachael, and combined it with the name of Muscle Man's girlfriend from Regular Show, Starla.
    <br>
    <br>
    After that first night, I picked up some cheap makeup and borrowed some dresses from another friend who was a crossdresser, I watched some youtube videos and had a good friend show me some techniques, I found myself becoming more enthusiastic as I learned more and went on nights out in university while dressed up, being told I was gorgeous was cathartic.
    
    <p>And thus, Rachael Starla was spawned! Like Barbies discontinued, lower rent, gruff equivalent: Butchie</p>
